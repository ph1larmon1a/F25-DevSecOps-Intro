> **Goal:** Practice secure Git fundamentals: signed commits, pre-commit secret scanning, and standardized PRs.  
> **Deliverable:** A PR from `feature/lab3` with all checklist items completed.

## Overview

In this lab you will practice:
- Verifying commit authenticity with **SSH commit signing**.  
- Preventing secrets with **pre-commit scanning** (TruffleHog + Gitleaks).  
- Standardizing collaboration with a **PR template & checklist**.  

These are the foundation of collaboration and trust in DevOps teams.

## Tasks

### Task 1 ‚Äî SSH Commit Signature Verification (5 pts)

**Objective:** Understand the importance of signed commits and set up SSH commit signature verification.

1. **Explore the Importance of Signed Commits**  
   - Research why commit signing is crucial for verifying the integrity and authenticity of commits.  
   - Resources:  
     - [GitHub Docs on SSH Commit Verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)  
     - [Atlassian Guide to SSH and Git](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/sign-commits-and-tags-with-ssh-keys-1305971205.html)  
   - Create a file `labs/submission3.md` with a short summary explaining the benefits of signing commits.

2. **Set Up SSH Commit Signing**  
   - **Option 1:** Use an existing SSH key and add it to GitHub.  
   - **Option 2 (recommended):** Generate a new key (ed25519)  
     ```sh
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```  
     Then add the public key to your GitHub account.

   - Configure Git to use your SSH key for signing:  
     ```sh
     git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR_SSH_KEY>
     git config --global commit.gpgSign true
     git config --global gpg.format ssh
     ```

3. **Make a Signed Commit**  
   - Create and sign a commit with your `submission3.md` file:  
     ```sh
     git commit -S -m "docs: add commit signing summary"
     ```  
   - Push this commit to your `feature/lab3` branch.

### Task 2 ‚Äî Pre-commit Hooks (4 pts)

**Objective:** Add a local Git pre-commit hook that scans staged changes for secrets using Dockerized TruffleHog and Gitleaks. The commit must be blocked if any secrets are found.

1. Create the pre-commit hook file
   - Path: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
   - Contents:
     ```bash
     #!/usr/bin/env bash
     set -euo pipefail

     echo "[pre-commit] scanning staged files for secrets‚Ä¶"

     # Collect staged files (added/changed)
     mapfile -t STAGED < <(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM)
     if [ ${#STAGED[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "[pre-commit] no staged files; skipping scans"
       exit 0
     fi

     # Limit to existing regular files only
     FILES=()
     for f in "${STAGED[@]}"; do
       [ -f "$f" ] && FILES+=("$f")
     done
     if [ ${#FILES[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "[pre-commit] no regular files to scan; skipping"
       exit 0
     fi

     # Run TruffleHog (Docker) against staged files
     echo "[pre-commit] TruffleHog scan‚Ä¶"
     docker run --rm \
       -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo \
       trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest \
       filesystem --fail --only-verified --json "${FILES[@]}" >/dev/null || {
         echo "\n‚úñ TruffleHog detected potential secrets in staged changes." >&2
         echo "Fix or unstage the offending files and try again." >&2
         exit 1
       }

     # Run Gitleaks (Docker) against staged changes
     echo "[pre-commit] Gitleaks scan‚Ä¶"
     docker run --rm \
       -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo \
       zricethezav/gitleaks:latest \
       detect --staged --redact --exit-code 1 --no-banner >/dev/null || {
         echo "\n‚úñ Gitleaks detected potential secrets in staged changes." >&2
         echo "Fix or unstage the offending files and try again." >&2
         exit 1
       }

     echo "‚úì No secrets detected; proceeding with commit."
     exit 0
     ```

2. Make the hook executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

3. Verify the hook blocks secrets
   - Add a test secret (e.g., a fake AWS key) to a file, stage it, and try to commit. The commit should be blocked by TruffleHog or Gitleaks.
   - Remove/redact the secret or unstage the file, then commit again to confirm it succeeds.

### Task 3 ‚Äî PR Template & Checklist (1 pt)

**Objective:** Standardize pull requests with a reusable template so reviewers see the same sections and a clear checklist every time.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **One-time bootstrap:** GitHub loads PR templates from the **default branch of the base repo** (your fork‚Äôs `main`). Add the template to `main` first, then open your lab PR from `feature/lab3`.

#### Steps

1. **Create (or source) a template on `main`**  
   Path: `.github/pull_request_template.md`  
   Commit message: `docs: add PR template`  
   - **Option A (discover):** Find a concise PR template from a reputable open-source project or GitHub docs and adapt it.  
   - **Option B (write your own):** Create a minimal template with these sections and a 3-item checklist:
     - Sections: **Goal**, **Changes**, **Testing**  
     - Checklist (3 items): clear title, docs/README updated if needed, no secrets/large temp files  
   - Keep it short and practical (aim for ‚â§ 30 lines).

2. **Create your lab branch and open a PR**  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/lab3
   # make a change (add labs/submission3.md)
   git add .
   git commit -m "docs: add lab3 submission stub"
   git push -u origin feature/lab3
   ```

Open a PR from `feature/lab3` ‚Üí `main` **in your fork**.

3. **Verify the template is applied**

   * The PR **description auto-fills** with your sections and the **3-item checklist**.
   * Fill in *Goal / Changes / Testing* and tick the checkboxes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

* ‚úÖ Branch `feature/lab3` exists with changes committed.
* ‚úÖ `labs/submission3.md` is present and at least one commit in the PR shows **‚ÄúVerified‚Äù** (signed via SSH) on GitHub.
* ‚úÖ A local `.git/hooks/pre-commit` runs TruffleHog and Gitleaks via Docker and blocks commits on detected secrets.
* ‚úÖ File `.github/pull_request_template.md` exists on the **main** branch.
* ‚úÖ A PR from `feature/lab3` ‚Üí `main` is open and **auto-filled** with the template, including **Goal / Changes / Testing** and the **3-item checklist** (boxes ticked).

## Rubric (10 pts)

| Criterion                                         | Points |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -----: |
| Task 1 ‚Äî SSH commit signing setup + summary       |  **5** |

## Hints

> üîê **Signed commit not showing ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù?** Ensure the email on your commits matches your GitHub account and that `gpg.format` is set to `ssh`.\
> üîé **Docker required for scans:** The pre-commit hook uses Docker images for TruffleHog and Gitleaks; ensure Docker Desktop/Engine is running.\
> üìù **Template didn‚Äôt load?** Confirm the path is `.github\pull_request_template.md` **on `main`** before opening the PR; re-open the PR description after adding it.\
> ‚úÇÔ∏è **Keep it short:** Reviewers read many PRs‚Äîconcise templates get filled, long ones get ignored.
