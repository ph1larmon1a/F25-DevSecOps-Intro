# 📌Lecture 3 - Secure Git & Secrets Management

## 📍 Slide 1 – 🌍 Brief History of Git

* 🧑‍💻 Git was created in **2005 by Linus Torvalds**, the same creator of the Linux kernel.
* ⚡ It was designed after the **BitKeeper licensing dispute**, to give the Linux community a free and open source Version Control System (VCS).
* 🛠️ Git quickly became popular due to its **speed, distributed nature, and branching model**.
* 🌐 Today, **over 90% of open source projects** use Git as their primary VCS.
* 🎉 Fun fact: Torvalds named Git after himself, calling it a “stupid content tracker.”

```

---

## 📍 Slide 5 – 🧾 Commit Identity Basics

* 🧑 Every Git commit contains **author information**: name & email.
* 🧑‍💻 The **committer** may differ from the author (e.g., when applying patches).
* 🖊️ This identity is only text metadata, so it can be **spoofed easily**.
* ⚠️ Without additional verification, **attackers could impersonate contributors**.
* ✅ Secure workflows use **signed commits** to prove authenticity.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    Note over Repo: Identity not verified<br/>Can be faked
```

---

## 📍 Slide 6 – 🖊️ Signed Commits Explained

* 🛡️ **Signed commits** use cryptographic keys to prove authenticity.
* 🔑 A commit includes a **digital signature** that can be verified.
* 🏷️ GitHub and GitLab display a “✔ Verified” badge for signed commits.
* ⚠️ Unsigned commits may be flagged as **unverified**, reducing trust.
* 📖 Fun fact: Some open source projects only accept **signed commits** in pull requests.

```mermaid

    Commit --> Repo[Remote Repo]
    Repo -->|Verify Signature| Trust[✔ Verified Commit]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 7 – 🔑 PGP/GPG Keys in Git

* 🔒 **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** implements **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)** encryption.
* 🗝️ Developers generate a **GPG key pair** (public + private keys).
* ✍️ Private key signs commits → Public key verifies authenticity.
* 🧩 Requires setting up Git to use GPG keys for signing.
* 🏢 Many enterprises enforce **GPG-signed commits** for compliance.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Developer Private Key] -->|Signs Commit| B[Signed Commit]
    B --> C[Public Repo]
    C --> D[Other Developers]
    D -->|Verify with Public Key| E[Trust Commit]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 8 – 🪪 SSH Signing of Commits

* 🔑 **SSH keys** (commonly used for repo access) can also sign commits.
* 🚀 Simpler setup than GPG — many developers already have SSH keys.
* 🛡️ Supported by Git 2.34+ and major platforms like GitHub.
* 🏢 Organizations can enforce **SSH-signed commits** at repository level.
* ⚖️ Comparison: SSH signing is **lighter** but less flexible than GPG.

```mermaid

    Repo -->|Verify SSH Key| Verified[✔ Verified Badge]
```

---
## 📍 Slide 9 – 🛡️ Verification of Commits in Platforms

* 🏢 GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket display commit signatures with badges.
* ✔️ A **green “Verified” label** means the signature matches a trusted key.
* ⚠️ A **yellow “Unverified” label** means signature exists but cannot be trusted.
* ❌ A **red “Bad signature” label** indicates possible tampering.
* 📊 Organizations can set policies to reject unverified commits in pull requests.

```mermaid

    Result -->|❌| Tampered[Bad Signature]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 10 – ⚖️ GPG vs SSH Commit Signing

* 🔑 **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)**

  * ✅ Flexible, widely supported, strong cryptography.
  * ❌ Setup is complex, key management can be hard for beginners.
* 🪪 **SSH Signing**

  * ✅ Easier setup, uses existing SSH keys.
  * ❌ Less flexible, limited to Git commit signing.
* 🧩 Many developers prefer SSH for convenience, but enterprises lean on GPG for compliance.
* 📖 Fun fact: Some projects allow **both GPG and SSH signatures** depending on contributor level.

```mermaid

    App --> Service[Database / API / Cloud]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 25 – 📜 Config Files & .gitignore

* 📝 Secrets often live in config files (`config.yaml`, `settings.json`).
* 🚨 Danger: config files can be accidentally committed to repos.
* 🛡️ Best practice: add them to `.gitignore` to keep them out of Git.
* ⚙️ Example `.gitignore` entry:

  ```bash
  # Ignore environment config
  .env
  config/*.json
  secrets/*
  ```
* 🎉 Fun fact: In 2013, a researcher found **thousands of AWS keys** in GitHub due to config file commits.
